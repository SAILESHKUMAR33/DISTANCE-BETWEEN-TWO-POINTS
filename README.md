# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation
### Step 2: 
Mention the coordinates as given
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4: 
Assign the values of coordinates in the formula
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
``` python

import math
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
distance=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print(round(distance,2))
```
  


### OUTPUT:
